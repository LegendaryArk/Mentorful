# Mentorful

## Inspiration

Did you know that nearly 50% of addicts relapse after rehab? That's an insane number to think about, and is not even including those not fortunate enough to find rehab programs. Canadian adults are not properly supported, making the path to recovery after crime, mental health issues, and addiction that much harder. But today, that changes with Mentorful, an application with tools to keep everyone on a positive path. By catering towards people going through rehabilitation, we help lost people reintegrate back into society and reduce rates of recidivism. This helps heal not just individuals, but the communities around them. 

## What it does

We accomplish this through two main features. Our first is a personalized reminder list to regularly track users’ progress as they grow. By checking their schedule through google login and the calendar API, we can access their daily schedules, and confirm that they are following their schedules and on track to achieve their goals. Furthermore, a categorized scoring system marks things like cleanliness so users can better understand their journey to recovery. 

Our second feature is a learning set catered towards large categories like cooking and personal hygiene, where users can see specific lessons like meal planning. As users become more comfortable, they can view more lessons and regain essential skills like time management, meal prepping, and laundry. Ultimately, these two features combine together to meet users’ day-to-day needs with lessons and positive reinforcement. 

## How we built it

We used Flutter for our mobile frontend, and FastAPI for our backend. We used Gemini and Google Calendar APIs.

## Challenges we ran into

We spent a lot of time pivoting between different ideas, and changed a lot from our first draft. In addition, we ran into a lot of visual bugs in flutter that took a long time to fix. Our builds would not work on a physical device, so we coded around emulators.

## What we learned

Being a team built up of many different levels of experience in hackathons, we learned how to work together to take advantage of everyone’s skillset. For example, this is the first hackathon for two of our members, so they had to learn time management skills and work around the 5 a.m. time crunches.
